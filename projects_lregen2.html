            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>As the Director of Propulsion at SFU Rocketry, I'm leading the development of the Liquid Rocket Engine (LRE) Gen-II, a 3kN engine utilizing ablative cooling methods. This project is characterized by its hands-on approach to rocket engine design from scratch, engaging a group of dedicated members in the process.

                Our work began with extensive materials research and ablative testing, leading to the selection of MDF wood as the primary ablative material for the engine. This choice was made based on its cost-effectiveness, burn-rate characteristics, and suitability for the engine's requirements. The design phase involved adapting the profile from our Gen-I Liquid Rocket Engine to incorporate new insights while maintaining familiarity for team members experienced with our systems.
                
                The LRE Gen-II's design features a combustion chamber, throat, and nozzle made from the selected ablative wood composite. This design is pivotal for the engine's operation, focusing on achieving efficient propulsion through the innovative use of materials. A significant aspect of the engine's design is its reusability, facilitated by replaceable ablative inserts, which allows for continuous improvement and testing.
                
                Another key component of the engine is the removable back injector plate, designed for quick materials and injector iteration. This feature enables us to experiment with different configurations and materials, enhancing the engine's performance and adaptability.
                
                The project is currently in progress, with team members actively involved in building and testing the engine. Our efforts are concentrated on realizing a functional and efficient rocket engine that leverages the unique properties of our chosen materials. Through this project, we're not only developing a new engine but also acquiring valuable skills and knowledge in rocketry and propulsion systems.

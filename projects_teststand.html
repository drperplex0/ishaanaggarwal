            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Within the SFU Rocketry team, I engaged in constructing a test stand structure designed to test and fire liquid rocket engines. This structure needed to be incredibly durable to withstand the substantial forces exerted by the engines during testing.

                My responsibilities were diverse, covering areas such as the manufacturing of piping and managing the positioning and utilization of tanks. A notable aspect of this project was the necessity for creativity driven by budget constraints. Our team had to think outside the box, repurposing materials to fit our needs. For example, we adapted scuba tanks for use in our test stand by tapping holes and fitting them with valves to control the intake and venting of fluids.
                
                Developing a test method for filling the LOX (liquid oxygen) tanks to the desired level presented another challenge. We achieved this through the calibration of liquid nitrogen, a more cost-effective alternative, to ensure accurate filling without the expense of using LOX for calibration.
                
                The test stand structure encompassed several key components:
                The main test stand,
                An engine mount,
                A fluid piping system,
                Five tanks, including a LOX tank, a fuel tank, two pressurant tanks (for both the LOX and fuel sides), and a nitrogen tank to supply pressurant for the system and facilitate purging.
                This project was a profound learning experience, not just in the technical aspects of rocket engine testing but also in the practical skills of resourcefulness and innovative problem-solving. The photos attached showcase the completed test stand and highlight the intricate work involved in its construction.<div id="project-images">

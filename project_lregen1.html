            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>I was part of the SFU Rocketry team that developed and fired a 2.5kN heatsink rocket engine. In this small team, my responsibilities were broad, encompassing several critical areas of the project.

                My work included designing the fluid systems and structurally assembling the combustion chamber, throat, and nozzle. I was also in charge of managing the oxidizer and fuel delivery systems for the engine. Handling liquid oxygen (LOX) was a significant part of my role, which involved creating LOX loading procedures, procurement, and developing a safety manual. Additionally, I conducted safety training for team members involved in handling LOX.
                
                The project required applying knowledge from mechanical engineering, propulsion, chemical engineering, and general rocketry principles. The small team size meant that each member had a wide range of tasks, leading to a steep and rapid learning experience in various engineering disciplines.
                
                The culmination of our efforts was the successful firing of the engine, a direct result of the team's dedication and the practical application of our collective engineering skills. This project not only provided hands-on experience in rocketry but also emphasized the importance of safety, precision, and interdisciplinary collaboration in achieving our goals.
                
                Here are some images from the engine firing, along with a video that captures the event. These materials showcase the engine's performance and the team's ability to translate theoretical knowledge into a practical, functioning rocket engine.

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>I worked on a project aimed at reducing hydrogen embrittlement in steel pipelines, crucial for the safety of Canadian energy infrastructure. This project was not only funded by but also conducted in conjunction with the National Research Council of Canada (NRC). Under the supervision of Dr. Sami Khan, we sought a practical solution to a problem that could affect the future of energy transport in Canada, especially as the government looks to mix hydrogen with fuel.

                The core of our solution was a monolayer coating designed to prevent hydrogen from diffusing through steel, thus significantly reducing the risk of embrittlement. This coating, a barrier merely one atom thick, proved to reduce hydrogen diffusion by 1000%. Its development was a blend of chemistry and engineering, bridging gaps in existing solutions for pipeline safety.
                
                To test our coating, I built specialized equipment inspired by the Devanathan-Stachurski cell. This involved glass-blowing to create a cell that could hold metal samples securely for diffusion testing. It was a hands-on challenge that required learning new skills and applying them directly to our research needs.
                
                Data algorithms were another pivotal part of the project. I developed these to predict the outcomes of our experiments, which significantly sped up the process, saving about two days per experiment. This efficiency was crucial for iterating our designs and refining the monolayer coating's effectiveness.
                
                Presenting our findings, alongside Dr. Khan, at the AMPP International Conference for Corrosion was a highlight of this project. Winning first place for our poster presentation was an honor, reflecting the importance and potential impact of our work.
                
                Transitioning my focus from physics to materials science and chemical engineering through this project was a learning curve. It was a hands-on experience in applying scientific principles to solve real-world problems, contributing to safer, more reliable pipeline infrastructure.</p>

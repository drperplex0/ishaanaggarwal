            <p>This website was created with the intention to share my work and thoughts.</p>
            <p>I am not a web developer and making this website has been an incredibly painful experience, and is still a work in progress.</p>
            <p>Enjoy the ride</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am currently an undergraduate student, about to finish my degree in Applied Physics Honours with a focus in Nuclear Engineering. Most of my day is comprised of learning and solving physics concepts through simulation, envelope calculations or whiteboards, sprinkled in with a lot of hair pulling.</p>
            <p>I believe in the power of the creator which is why I work with a research lab developing equipment to build and test for the creation of nuclear isotopes, as well as serve as the director of propulsion for the university rocketry club. The rocketry club has allowed me to get my hands dirty with a lot of physical projects demanding all sorts of engineering disciplines. </p>
            <p>My professional focus is on the creation of energy sources being used in multiple departments. Currently fascinated with the work on fusion energy.</p>
